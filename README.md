# Mars simulator exercises

**These are MIPS architecture assembly codes written with MARS simulator**



**STEP 1: Download JRE8 if you don't have one.**

Download link: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html

You can download either 8u201 or 8u202. Both works.

Preferably, download JRE8 at this path. "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_201\bin\java.exe"

Or, take a memo of the directory where your JRE8 is at.



**STEP 2: Download or clone this git, preferably at "C:\Mars4_5.jar"**

Or, take a memo of the directory where your Mars4_5.jar is at.



**STEP 3: If your directory of JRE8 or Mars4_5.jar are not identical as above mentioned, edit the "__init__ mars.bat" file with notepad or any text editor as:
"*Your JRE8 directory*" -jar "*Your Mars4_5 directory*"**

For example,

"C:\ProgramData\Oracle\Java\javapath\java.exe" -jar "C:\mars\Mars4_5.jar"



**STEP 4: Double click the "__init__mars.bat" file. Cmd will be initiated and so will the mars simulator. Or, just double click (or right click and then execute) Mars4_5.jar
but make sure you execute the file with JRE8.**



**STEP 5: If the layout of mars simulator is too small, it's because of the resolution of your computer display, so go to the directory of JRE8 or whatever program you are
executing Mars with, and then right click the java.exe (or the .exe file you're executing Mars with)**



In the right-click drop-down menu, click **Properties**, then click **Compatibility** tab, then check **Override high DPI scaling behavior**, and finally, in **Scaling performed by**, choose **System**.
Click *Apply* and then *Save*. Close it. And rerun the Mars simulator.



**STEP 6: Click *Settings* tab on the top, click *Editor...*, change *Font Size*. This will change the font size of the codes you write.**



**STEP 7: Click *Files* tab on the top, click *Open*, go to directory where these git files are, choose any of the .asm files.**



**STEP 8: Click *Run* tab on the top, click *Assemble*, click *green* button that looks like a play button(Run the current program).**
